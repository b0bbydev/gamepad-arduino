# Arduino Gamepad
This project was done for an Internet of Things class in first semester. It uses an Arduino Leonardo with the '1Sheeld' attachment. The 1Sheeld is what allows communication to your smartphone over bluetooth.

## Hardware Used
* 321 Makers Kit - Includes: Arduino Leonardo, USB cable + a few attachments - <a href="http://insanesupply.com/321-maker-college-kit">get one here</a>
* 1Sheeld - <a href="https://1sheeld.com/">get one here</a>

## Software Used
* Code was written in the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">Arduino IDE</a>
* Written in Java

### How It Works
* After connecting the 1Sheeld to the board of the Arduino, connect it to a PC via the supplied USB cable.
* Open the Arduino IDE and write some code into the editor. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/docs">documentation</a> for ideas or feel free to use my <a href="https://github.com/b0bbydev/gamepad-arduino/blob/master/GamePad_-_Arduino.ino">code!</a>

> Keep in mind that when trying to upload to the 1Sheeld board, that it is in "upload mode" by toggling a switch on the side of the board. And then toggling it back to "operating mode" when finished uploading.
